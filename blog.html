      <b>Entry 1: Assignment 0</b>
      <br> this assignment was challenging for me mainly beacuse I had no knowledge of html or git and github. I really was clueless on how to start.
      I was strugling but Piazza helped a lot it was my to go to for help. I was learning a lot from the conversations and the useful links they provided. In the process i feel more comftorable 
    using git and github. Although ive never seen html before so far it isnt that bad.
